# PRODUCT_SENSE

## Product Positioning

A multimodal RAG backend for document QA, deep research, graph search, and conversation persistence.

## Core User Jobs

1. Upload and process PDFs into searchable knowledge.
2. Ask grounded questions with retrieval and optional deep research decomposition.
3. Analyze multimodal evidence including images and graph relationships.
4. Persist and revisit prior research sessions.

## Value Drivers

- Modular API surface for frontend integration.
- Hybrid retrieval plus graph-enhanced reasoning.
- SSE progress visibility for long-running research tasks.

## Product Risks

1. Long-running AI/OCR tasks can increase timeout/retry complexity.
2. Schema drift can break frontend integrations.
3. Security posture needs stronger controls for public multi-tenant deployment.
